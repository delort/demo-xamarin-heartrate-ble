# Demo Xamarin Heartrate Bluetooth BLE reading
in this sample I use the library found in [xamarin-bluetooth-le](https://github.com/xabre/xamarin-bluetooth-le) to read heart rate and battery level from a Polar H7. I have used this sample to test the integration of BLE Heart Rate Characteristics reading for [Caledos Runner](https://api.caledos.com) for android. Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed writing it:-)
