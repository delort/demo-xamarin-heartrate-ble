# Demo Xamarin Heartrate Bluetooth BLE read
in this sample I use the library found in xamarin-bluetooth-le to read heart rate and battery level from a polar H7. I have used this sample to test the integration of BLE HR reading for Caledos Runner for android. Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed writing it:-)
